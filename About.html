            Hand rehabilitation gloves device....... This is a device that
            contains a system using electrical motor we designed for people It
            is partially lost the ability to properly control the Musculator of
            the hand, for example after stroke or spinal cord injury and
            accidents. Which the system can move the hand and fingers. With this
            device, these exercises can be repeated for a specific period
            determined by the doctor and controlled by the device and repeated
            for months. And the restoration of normal movement can
            reach...60%-70% for the nature of the hand movement and reaching the
            highest goal, which is to reduce pain for people with infection, as
            well as there are no side effects in the event that treatment is not
            successful. The research results indicate
            <span id="image-contaniner"></span>that the designed glove with
            electrical motor can <span id="image-contaniner"></span>meet the
            requirements of hand rehabilitation.
